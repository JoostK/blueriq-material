For an overview of the datepicker component you can find the information here: https://material.angular.io/components/datepicker/overview

#### Datatype
The datepicker is a field with the datatype `date`.

When the attribute has a read only flag, only the value of the attribute is presented (as text). If the attribute does not have a value, nothing is shown.
